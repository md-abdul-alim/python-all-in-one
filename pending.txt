is python high / low level language?
=> python is a high-level language, because of it is a high level design, it is more abstract and user-friendly.
This abstraction hides many low-level details of computure hardware and memory management.
Becuase of high level nature it allows developers to write come more quickly.

is python compiler or interpreter language?
=> python is an interpreted language. That means python code is excuted directly by the python interpreter without need
for other seperate compilation step.
=> Python interpreter reads and executes the code line by line by translating it into machine code on the fly.
=> python interpreted languages is slower in execution compared to compiled languages since they don't produce native
machine code optimized for a specific platform.
